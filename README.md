# arduino-ultrasound-distance-measurement

This is an Arduino Uno project for forwarding distance measurement data provided
by an ultrasound device through a USB serial stream.

# Additional devices used

* HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
* OCTOPUS 036A Segmentric LED Brick
* breadboard, resistors, wires and other tools according to the wiring schemas

# Wiring

Wiring is only partially provided in the [Ultrasound_distance.ino](https://github.com/sedlakmate/arduino-ultrasound-distance-measurement/blob/master/Ultrasound_distance/Ultrasound_distance/Ultrasound_distance.ino) file.

# Deployment

For deploying the code, the official [Arduino applications](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) are suggested.
